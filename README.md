This repository contains tools developed to reduce a set
of DECam images acquired to map SII and Ha emission in the 
Magellanic Clouds


To use these tools this directory should be placed both
in PATH and PYTHONPATh

The tools require a set of relatively commmon modules, such
as astropy, and normally are run from within an approprate 
conda enviromnment.
